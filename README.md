# Java Coding Problems

Hello. 

These are the most coding problems during
technical interviews, as I experienced it myself.

## Running The Code

It's the convenience of the Codespaces online!
Simply create a Codespace, you don't need to install
anything, just simply run using Bash.

Also starting Java 11, you can now run it even without compiling !

```
cd src
```

then 

```
java [NameOfTheFile].java
```

this is the interface of the online Codespaces

enjoy !
